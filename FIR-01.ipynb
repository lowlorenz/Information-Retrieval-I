We have previously observed spatial uncoupling of optical intrinsic signal imaging (OIS) and evoked potential (EP) responses in rodent barrel cortex following simultaneous whisker and forelimb stimulation, leading to changes in OIS response magnitude. To further test the hypothesis that this uncoupling may have resulted from \"passive\" overspill of perfusion-related responses between functional regions, we conducted the present study using temporally staggered rather than simultaneous whisker and forelimb stimulation. This paradigm minimized overlap of neural responses in barrel cortex and forelimb primary somatosensory cortex (SI), while maintaining overlap of vascular response time courses between regions. When contrasted with responses to 1.5-s lone-whisker stimulation, staggered whisker and forelimb stimulation resulted in broadening of barrel cortex OIS response time course in the temporal direction of forelimb stimulation. OIS response peaks were also temporally shifted toward the forelimb stimulation period; time-to-peak was shorter (relative to whisker stimulus onset) when forelimb stimulation preceded whisker stimulation and longer when forelimb stimulation followed whisker stimulation. In contrast with OIS and EP magnitude decreases previously observed during simultaneous whisker/forelimb stimulation, barrel cortex OIS response magnitude increased during staggered stimulation and no detectable changes in underlying EP activity were observed. Spatial extent of barrel cortex OIS responses also increased during staggered stimulation. These findings provide further evidence for spatial uncoupling of OIS and EP responses, and emphasize the importance of temporal stimulus properties on the effects of this uncoupling. It is hypothesized that spatial uncoupling is a result of passive overspill of perfusion-related responses into regions distinct from those which are functionally active. It will be important to consider potential influences of this uncoupling when designing and interpreting functional imaging studies that use hemodynamic responses to infer underlying neural activity.', 'AD': 'Laboratory of Neuro Imaging, Department of Neurology, Division of Brain Mapping, University of California, Los Angeles, California 90095, USA.', 'CY': 'United States', 'DA': '20020701', 'DCOM': '20020906', 'DP': '2002 Jul', 'EDAT': '2002/07/02 10:00', 'ID': 'MH-52083/MH/NIMH', 'IP': '1', 'IS': '0022-3077', 'JID': '0375404', 'LA': 'eng', 'MHDA': '2002/09/07 10:01', 'PG': '422-37', 'PMID': '12091565', 'PST': 'ppublish', 'PT': 'Journal Article', 'SB': 'IM', 'SO': 'J Neurophysiol 2002 Jul;88(1):422-37.', 'TA': 'J Neurophysiol', 'TI': 'Temporally staggered forelimb stimulation modulates barrel cortex optical intrinsic signal responses to whisker stimulation.', 'UI': '22086349', 'VI': '88', 'MH': ['Animal', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Forelimb/*physiology', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Male', 'Optics', 'Photic Stimulation', 'Physical Stimulation/methods', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Reaction Time', 'Regional Blood Flow/physiology', 'Somatosensory Cortex/blood supply/*physiology', \"Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.\", 'Time Factors', 'Vibration', 'Vibrissae/*physiology'], 'FAU': ['Blood, Anne J', 'Pouratian, Nader', 'Toga, Arthur W']}}, {'_index': 'genomics', '_type': '_doc', '_id': 'qVENtXQBu6mw5_RMAp44', '_score': 11.241689, '_source': {'AB': 'Projections of the casualties expected during peacekeeping operations allow medical planners to assess in advance the medical resources needed to support such operations.

We measured cerebral blood flow in chronically instrumented fetal sheep (127-135 days gestation, term approximately 145 days) using laser Doppler flowmetry probes implanted in the parietal cortices. Hypoxia was administered for 30 min by lowering the ewe's inspired oxygen to 10-12 % during an infusion of either saline or theophylline, a non-specific adenosine receptor antagonist. The theophylline infusion was begun 30 min prior to and ended 30 min after the completion of the hypoxic insult. The administration of theophylline had no significant effect on cerebral blood flow during the baseline period. During control hypoxic periods, cerebral blood flow increased by approximately 45 %. During theophylline experiments, however, there was no significant increase in cerebral blood flow during hypoxia. In the control experiments, cerebral blood flow returned to baseline levels during the recovery period, while in the theophylline experiments cerebral blood flow fell below baseline levels. We conclude that, in the near-term ovine fetus, adenosine plays a minimal role in the regulation of basal cerebral blood flow. However, these data are strong evidence for the involvement of adenosine in increased fetal cerebral blood flow during an acute hypoxic insult. Finally, adenosine may also play an important role in the maintenance of fetal cerebral blood flow immediately following hypoxic insult.\", 'AD': 'Center for Perinatal Biology, School of Medicine, Loma Linda University, Loma Linda, CA 92350, USA.', 'AID': 'PHY_023077 [pii]', 'CY': 'England', 'DA': '20020916', 'DCOM': '20030225', 'DP': '2002 Sep 15', 'EDAT': '2002/09/17 10:00', 'ID': 'HL65494/HL/NHLBI', 'IP': 'Pt 3', 'IS': '0022-3751', 'JID': '0266262', 'LA': 'eng', 'MHDA': '2003/02/26 04:00', 'PG': '1015-23', 'PMID': '12231655', 'PST': 'ppublish', 'PT': 'Journal Article', 'SB': 'IM', 'SO': 'J Physiol 2002 Sep 15;543(Pt 3):1015-23.', 'TA': 'J Physiol', 'TI': 'The role of adenosine in regulation of cerebral blood flow during hypoxia in the near-term fetal sheep.', 'UI': '22218382', 'VI': '543', 'MH': ['Adenosine/blood/*physiology', 'Animal', 'Blood Glucose', 'Blood Pressure', 'Carbon Dioxide/blood', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation/*drug effects/*physiology', 'Female', 'Gestational Age', 'Heart Rate', 'Hemoglobins', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Hypoxia, Brain/*physiopathology', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Lactic Acid/blood', 'Laser-Doppler Flowmetry', 'Oxygen/blood', 'Pregnancy', 'Receptors, Purinergic P1/antagonists & inhibitors', \"Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.\", \"Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.\", 'Theophylline/pharmacology', 'Vascular Resistance/drug effects/physiology', 'Vasodilator Agents/pharmacology'], 'RN': ['0 (Blood Glucose)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Receptors, Purinergic P1)', '0 (Vasodilator Agents)', '124-38-9 (Carbon Dioxide)', '50-21-5 (Lactic Acid)', '58-55-9 (Theophylline)', '58-61-7 (Adenosine)', '7782-44-7 (Oxygen)'], 'FAU': ['Blood, Arlin B', 'Hunter, Christian J', 'Power, Gordon G']}}, {'_index': 'genomics', '_type': '_doc', '_id': 'U00KtXQBu6mw5_RMIEcE', '_score': 9.481224, '_source': {'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Current procedures for the cryopreservation of umbilical cord blood (UCB) progenitor cells, which are based on techniques used for BM, have had varying degrees of success (survival 9-118%). Improving the effectiveness of UCB cell therapies demands a more comprehensive understanding of freezing injury during cryopreservation. METHODS: Leukocyte concentrates from UCB, with or without 10% DMSO were cooled at 1 degrees C/min to different subzero temperatures (-5 to -50 degrees C), then either thawed directly (thaw) or plunged into liquid nitrogen before thawing (plunge). Single-platform flow cytometry with 7-amino-actinomycin D was used to directly quantify survival of CD34(+) cells. Fluorescent microscopy was used to examine plasma membrane integrity of nucleated cells. RESULTS: Without DMSO, recovery of nucleated cells was approximately 80% for both thaw and plunge. Survival was 9%, indicating damage to the plasma membrane. With 10% DMSO, nucleated cell recovery was also approximately 80%, indicating that DMSO does not improve recovery of nucleated cells. Survival, however, was much higher with DMSO, > 60% for nucleated cells thawed directly, and 30-55% for cells thawed from plunge, demonstrating cryoprotection conferred by DMSO. With DMSO, survival of CD34(+) cells was higher than that of nucleated cells, indicating that CD34(+) cells with 10% DMSO are more tolerant to cryopreservation than the total nucleated cell population.
